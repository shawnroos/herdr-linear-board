# Idempotent launcher for the board overlay — used by both the `open-board` action
# and a herdr keybinding (`[[keys.command]]` with `type = "shell"`). Mirrors
# herdr-file-viewer's launcher: "open-or-focus, toggle off on repeat".
#
#   - no board pane in the current workspace     -> open the overlay (focused)
#   - a board pane exists but isn't focused        -> focus it
#   - the focused pane IS the board pane           -> close it (herdr has no
#                                                     hide-without-close; reopening
#                                                     is cheap — the TUI refetches)
#
# herdr actions/keybindings run a command (no declarative "open this pane" field),
# so this shells out to the herdr CLI via $HERDR_BIN_PATH (herdr injects it; fall
# back to `herdr` on PATH). The pane is identified by its static title (`Board`),
# the legacy filter title, the scoped title (`Board [scope · FILTER]`), or the Linear
# mode title (`Linear: <bound object>`). A board title this does not match is silent:
# every press opens another overlay. Any failure degrades to OPEN.
