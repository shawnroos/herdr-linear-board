# herdr-board

This is the operational skill for people and dispatched agents using herdr-board. It covers the TUI,
CLI, cards, runs, comments, columns, and Herdr-backed spaces; it does not prescribe how to develop,
prototype, test, or release herdr-board itself.

A **card** is a title/description plus harness/model/effort, optional harness permission, and a target
Herdr session and workspace. New cards default to Pi; the built-in catalog is `pi`, `claude`, `codex`,
`opencode`, `antigravity` (in that order), then any config-defined `[harness.NAME]`. **Columns** are pipeline stages: `manual` waits
for a person and `auto` dispatches a visible agent run on entry. Each canonical Git root (or exact
non-Git CWD) is a **project** holding named boards (every project's first board is `main`); the
preserved `Global` project remains available. Agents report
through `board`; never edit the database. The daemon owns state and column transitions.

## Inside a run

`$BOARD_CARD_ID`, `$BOARD_RUN_ID`, and `$BOARD_SOCKET` are preset. `board comment` posts as
`agent:$BOARD_RUN_ID` when the run id is present. Do the stage's work, comment the result, then close
the run.

Rules — follow exactly:

- **Always comment before `board done`.** The next stage receives the comments; a bare `done` loses
  your useful result.
- `board done --outcome ok` means the stage goal was met. `--outcome fail` means it was not met;
  `fail` is a semantic verdict, not merely a report of a recovered tool error.
- **Never move, cancel, or retry your own card to advance it.** `board done` applies the column's
  transition. Use cancel/retry only when the operator or task explicitly requires it.
- A card id is optional for top-level `comment` and `done`; both default to `$BOARD_CARD_ID`.

```bash
board comment "Implemented X; added tests, all green. Touched src/foo.rs."
board done --outcome ok --summary "feature X shipped, tests green"
# If the stage goal was not met:
board done --outcome fail --summary "2 integration tests still fail; needs schema work"
```

## TUI

Run `board tui` or invoke the `open-board` Herdr plugin action. Use arrows or `h/j/k/l` to navigate,
`n` for a card, `N` for a column, `m` to move a card (form fields: Project → Board → Column →
Position; the move never changes the selection), `M` to reorder the focused column, `O` to
reorder the selected card within its column (`j`/`k` stage, `Enter` commits, `Esc` cancels),
`Enter` for detail, `e`/`E` to edit a card/column, `a` to archive/restore, `v` for
active/all/archived visibility, `p` to switch project, `b` to switch board, and `?` for help.
Moving into an `auto` column dispatches a run. `o` focuses the newest same-session run pane; `Enter`
on an `awaiting` card confirms it through the same completion channel as `board done --outcome ok`.
Below 60 columns the TUI switches to a single-column Compact layout with a tappable
`‹ [ ⇄ <column> n/N] ›` header; the project and board selectors appear as separate `Project:` /
`Board:` header rows at every breakpoint (`b` opens the board picker directly; `⇄ Other projects…`
drills to the project picker).

## CLI taxonomy

The nested forms are canonical. `--board` (a stable id or canonical scope path), `--project` (a
canonical scope path), and `--json` are all
**global** flags: either position parses identically, before or after the subcommand path.

```bash
board --board <ID|PATH> card list --json
board card list --board <ID|PATH> --json     # identical
board --project /path/to/repo board list
```

Without `--board`/`--project`, board-aware commands use the **selected project** (and its selected
board); `BOARD_SCOPE_PATH` is a deterministic automation override that bootstraps the selection at
startup when none exists yet. `card create/list`, `column list`, and
board commands use the selected project/board. Card-id operations infer the card's own board.

### Projects and boards

```bash
board project list [--json]
board project show [PATH] [--json]
board project create PATH [--json]
board project select PATH [--board ID|NAME] [--json]
board board list [--all|--project PATH] [--json]
board board show [ID|PATH|NAME] [--json]
board board open <PATH> [--json]
board board create NAME [--project PATH] [--json]
board board select ID|NAME [--project PATH] [--json]
board board rename [SELECTOR] NAME [--json]
board template apply pipeline [--json]
```

A project is a canonical scope path (Git root or existing directory). `project create` requires the
directory to already exist and never creates one; it auto-selects the project and its first board
`main`. `project select` optionally picks one of the project's boards by id or name. `board list`
defaults to the selected project's boards (`--all` lists every project's, `--project PATH` picks
another project); `board create` names a board in a project (case-insensitively unique there) and
auto-selects it; `board select` persists a board — and its project — as the context; `board open`
keeps its open-or-create semantics and `BoardSnapshot` output but resolves the project's
selected-or-main board without changing the selection. `board show` and `board open` return a snapshot with `board`, `columns`, `cards`, and `active_runs`.
The `pipeline` template is atomic and only applies to an empty board containing exactly the seed
`Todo` column; it returns the resulting column array.

### Cards

```bash
board card create --title TITLE [-d DESCRIPTION] [--column COLUMN] \
  [--harness HARNESS] [--model MODEL] [--effort EFFORT] [--permission MODE] \
  [--session SESSION] [--space-kind workspace|new-workspace] \
  [--space-ref REF] [--space-cwd DIR] [--json]
board card edit ID [--title TITLE] [-d DESCRIPTION] [--clear-description] \
  [--harness HARNESS] [--model MODEL|--clear-model] [--effort EFFORT|--clear-effort] \
  [--permission MODE|--clear-permission] [--session SESSION|--clear-session] \
  [--space-ref REF|--clear-space-ref] [--space-cwd DIR|--clear-space-cwd] [--json]
board card show ID [--json]
board card list [--column COLUMN] [--visibility active|all|archived] [--json]
board card move ID COLUMN [--position ZERO_BASED_POSITION] [--destination-board ID|PATH] [--to-project PATH --to-board NAME|ID] [--json]
board card duplicate ID [--json]
board card archive ID [--json]
board card restore ID [--json]
board card delete ID [--yes] [--json]
```

`card duplicate` copies a card into a fresh idle card inserted directly below it: title gains
` (copy)`, and description, harness, model, effort, permission mode, session, and space
configuration are copied verbatim — but status is `idle` with no runs, comments, conversation id,
or archive flag. The original is never modified, and the copy is never dispatched, even in an
auto column; run it (or move it) explicitly like any idle card. In the TUI, `C` duplicates the
focused card from the board or card detail.

`card new` is retained as an alias for `card create`. A new card defaults to Pi; an omitted model or
effort uses the harness default. `--harness codex` selects the built-in Codex adapter: models are
free-form (`--model` any string), every effort level is accepted (`off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`;
`off` is delivered to codex as `model_reasoning_effort=none`), and `--permission` takes
`ask-for-approval|approve-for-me|full-access`. These are board-facing presets: ask on request in a
workspace-write sandbox, automatic review in a workspace-write sandbox, or bypass approvals and
sandbox respectively. Codex mints its own conversation thread id —
the board never invents one — and captures the integration-reported id after launch, so later stages
can `resume`/`fork` the same conversation; a minted run whose id was never reported cannot be
reopened by id (`card run focus` refuses; use `card run retry` for a new run).
`--harness antigravity` selects the built-in Antigravity CLI adapter (Herdr kind/executable `agy`):
models come from the live `agy --output-format json models` catalog (free-form when the catalog is
unavailable), efforts are `low|medium|high` per model (a fixed-effort model offers none), `--permission`
takes `sandbox|always-proceed` (no permission set keeps your own configured default), and resume/retry
re-attach to the SAME conversation with `--conversation <id>` — antigravity has no fork. The id is
self-minted by the CLI and captured from the Herdr integration after launch, so it must be installed
(`herdr integration install antigravity-cli`) for reuse/rescue to work.
`new-workspace` requires both `--space-ref` and `--space-cwd`. For an existing `workspace`, set
`--space-cwd` when its live panes intentionally use different directories; without it, dispatch
requires all non-empty live pane cwd values to agree and fails closed when they differ.
Creating directly in an `auto` column dispatches immediately. `card list` defaults to active cards;
`all` includes archived cards and `archived` returns only archived cards. `card show` includes current
comments and run history; soft-deleted comments are omitted.

A cross-board move goes on `--destination-board` (an id or path); a cross-**project** move uses
`--to-project PATH --to-board NAME|ID`, and neither ever changes the persistent selection or
recency. The old fallback — a global `--board` naming a
*different* board than the card's — still works but prints a deprecation warning to stderr; do not
write new automation against it.

Omitted edit options are unchanged. Explicit `--clear-*` flags clear nullable values;
`--clear-description` sets the description to an empty string. Harness is required and cannot be
cleared (`--clear-harness` parses but is refused). Model/effort/permission/session/space edits are
refused while a card has an open run.
Archiving and deletion also require an idle/terminal card; cancel an open run first. Delete is
permanent and removes card history. It prompts on a TTY and requires `--yes` in non-interactive use.

### Comments

```bash
board card comment add CARD_ID BODY [--json]
board card comment show COMMENT_ID [--json]
board card comment edit COMMENT_ID BODY [--json]
board card comment delete COMMENT_ID [--yes] [--json]
board card comment history COMMENT_ID [--json]
```

Add returns the compact current comment (`id`, `card_id`, `author`, `body`, `created_at`);
show/edit return the current record with those fields plus `deleted_at`; `card show` prints each
comment in that same one-line shape. Delete is a soft delete and
returns `{"deleted":true}`. History returns immutable snapshots from creation through the latest
edit; deletion marks the final snapshot. Card detail and run prompts show only non-deleted comments.

When `$BOARD_RUN_ID` is set, add creates `author=agent:<run-id>`, and that open durable run may
edit or delete only comments owned by its exact `agent:<run-id>` author. Calls without a run id are
human operations and may edit/delete non-system comments. System comments are immutable; deleted
comments are immutable. The legacy `board comment [CARD_ID] BODY` form remains available and defaults
the card id to `$BOARD_CARD_ID`.

### Runs

```bash
board card run done [CARD_ID] --outcome ok|fail [--summary SUMMARY] [--json]
board card run confirm [CARD_ID] [--summary SUMMARY] [--json]
board card run cancel CARD_ID [--json]
board card run retry CARD_ID [--json]
board card run focus CARD_ID RUN_ID [--origin-socket SOCKET] [--json]
```

`card run confirm` is the `done --outcome ok` channel for an `awaiting` card. `card run focus`
takes an explicit `RUN_ID` (there is no implicit "latest run"; read it from `card show --json`
`runs[]`), returns
`{action, recorded_pane_id?, run_id, card_id, column_id, harness, session, session_id, pane_id}`,
and requires that run's pane to belong to the current Herdr session; `session` is the herdr session
name while `session_id` is the harness conversation id. Without `--origin-socket` it uses
`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` or `HERDR_SOCK`.

`action` tells you what happened: `focused_recorded_pane` (the run's pane was alive),
`focused_rescued_pane` (its pane is gone but an earlier reopen's pane is still alive), or `rescued`
(its pane is gone, so the harness conversation was **resumed in a new pane** in the card's tab). A
rescue never re-sends the card task and never writes to the database, so the reopened pane is
ephemeral: it has no run row and is not watched or timed out. It gets `BOARD_CARD_ID`/`BOARD_SOCKET`
but deliberately **no** `BOARD_RUN_ID`, so from inside it `board comment` still records on the card
(as a human comment) while `board done` does not apply — the run stays closed. Closing the pane is up
to you. Resuming requires an explicit per-harness capability (all five built-ins — `pi`, `claude`,
`codex`, `opencode`, and `antigravity` — have it; a `[harness.NAME]` harness needs `resume = true`)
and a recorded conversation id;
without either, focus is refused explicitly — use `card run retry` for a new run instead.

Done/cancel/retry return `{run, card}` in JSON. Retry creates a new run while preserving history.

### Columns and discovery

```bash
board column list [--json]
board column create --name NAME [--prompt TEXT] [--trigger manual|auto] \
  [--on-success COLUMN] [--on-fail COLUMN] [--fresh-session|--reuse-session] \
  [--harness HARNESS] [--model MODEL] [--effort EFFORT] [--permission MODE] \
  [--timeout MINUTES] [--position ZERO_BASED_POSITION] [--json]
board column show COLUMN [--json]
board column edit COLUMN [--name NAME] [--prompt TEXT|--clear-prompt] \
  [--trigger manual|auto] [--on-success COLUMN|--clear-on-success] \
  [--on-fail COLUMN|--clear-on-fail] [--fresh-session|--reuse-session] \
  [--harness HARNESS|--clear-harness] [--model MODEL|--clear-model] \
  [--effort EFFORT|--clear-effort] [--permission MODE|--clear-permission] \
  [--timeout MINUTES|--clear-timeout] [--json]
board column reorder COLUMN ZERO_BASED_POSITION [--json]
board column delete COLUMN [--move-cards-to COLUMN] [--yes] [--json]
board harness list [--json]
board harness models [HARNESS] [--json]
board harness efforts [HARNESS] --model MODEL [--json]
board harness permissions [HARNESS] [--json]
board space list [--session SESSION] [--json]
board session list [--json]
```

`HARNESS` is a positional and defaults to `pi`; `harness efforts` additionally **requires**
`--model`. Column references accept an id or case-insensitive name. List and reorder return ordered
arrays; create/show/edit return a column. `--fresh-session` and `--reuse-session` conflict at
**parse time** — passing both is a usage error (exit 64), not a runtime rejection.
A column containing cards needs `--move-cards-to`; any open card run blocks deletion. Column
settings are validated as a complete merged configuration, and effective card+column settings are
checked again before dispatch. Pi has no permission modes; `bypassPermissions` is never a column
override.

### Linear mode (a board for a bound herdr space)

```bash
board linear snapshot [WORKSPACE_ID] [--json]
board linear space list [--json]
board linear project list [--json]
board linear view list <PROJECT_ID> [--json]
```

- Inside a herdr pane whose space the `work` plugin has bound to a Linear project
  (`HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, or the plugin context's `workspace_id`, is set), `board tui` opens a
  Linear board for that space instead of the kanban: columns are the recorded Linear
  view's groups (or the team's workflow states when no view is chosen), cards are the project's
  issues, and each card lists its worktree bindings, recorded tabs and live pane status. It writes
  nothing to Linear, the plugin's records or SQLite. Its herdr writes are its pane title
  (`Linear: <project or space>`), focusing an existing pane (`o`), and, when the person chooses a
  space's project, a view (`v`) or `b` on a card, one new `bind` tab running Claude with the
  plugin's `/work:bind` skill. `r` refreshes; `u` opens the issue; `y` copies the worktree path.
  Card-owning verbs are refused with a toast. Outside herdr the kanban is unchanged.
- `board linear snapshot [WORKSPACE_ID]` is the same read as JSON; with no positional it reads
  `$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, and fails without contacting the daemon when that is unset: the daemon runs the plugin's
  `bin/work-snapshot.sh` for that space and attaches a `pane_status` map (`working`, `idle`,
  `blocked`, `done`, `unknown`). Every section carries its own `status` (`ok`, `unavailable`,
  `unknown`, `missing`); exit 0 means a document came back, not that every source was reachable.
- The daemon finds the plugin through `BOARD_WORK_PLUGIN_ROOT` (yours first, sent with the request,
  then the daemon's), then `[daemon] work_plugin_root` in the board config, then the installed
  `work@shrimpshack` plugin; it needs plugin `0.4.0` or newer. A missing or too-old plugin is
  protocol code 6 (`work plugin unavailable`), exit 6, for the snapshot and the three list verbs. All of these are read on every request, so a
  change takes effect without restarting the daemon. The error never includes the script's stderr;
  it names the command to run by hand to see it.
- `board linear space list`, `project list` and `view list <PROJECT_ID>` run the plugin's
  `bin/work-spaces.sh`, `bin/work-projects.sh` and `bin/work-views.sh`. `--json` prints the
  plugin's envelope `{"status": ..., "message": ..., "rows": [...]}`, with `status` one of `ok`,
  `unavailable`, `partial` or `unknown` and `message` a string or `null`. Rows are
  `{id, label, live, state, project_id, project_name}` for spaces (every space, bound or not),
  `{id, name, team_key}` for projects (the projects you are a member of) and `{id, name}` for
  views. The text form prints a `status:` line first when the status is not `ok`, then a table.
  Like the snapshot, exit 0 means a list came back, not that every source was reachable. A project
  id must be 1 to 64 ASCII letters, digits, `_` or `-`, starting with a letter or digit.
- Focusing a pane (`o` in the Linear board) has no CLI verb on purpose: it moves the person's view
  in herdr, which an agent has no reason to do. An agent that needs a pane's state reads
  `pane_status` from `board linear snapshot`.
- Starting a bind from the board (a strip space's project, `v`, or `b` on a card) has no CLI verb on
  purpose: it opens a new herdr tab and starts a Claude session for a person to confirm in, which an
  agent has no reason to do. An agent that needs a bind runs the plugin's `/work:bind` skill itself,
  with the ids the list verbs print.

### TUI, daemon, version, skill

```bash
board tui
board daemon start [--foreground]
board daemon stop [--json]
board daemon status [--json]
board version [--json]
board skill
```

- `board tui` opens the kanban TUI, auto-starting boardd. `daemon start` runs boardd in this
  process; `--foreground` additionally logs to stderr and stays attached. Bare `board daemon` (no
  subcommand) is unchanged, and the historical `board daemon --foreground` / `board daemon --stop`
  flags still work but are hidden from `--help`.
- `daemon status` is the operational probe: `{version, db_path, herdr_connected, active_runs,
  queued_runs}`. `daemon stop --json` reports `{"stopped": bool, "was_running": bool}`; it is
  fail-closed and errors rather than removing a socket it cannot prove is stale.
- `board version --json` never starts boardd and reports `{cli_version, daemon_version}`. The daemon
  value is `null`/`unavailable` when boardd is offline; use daemon status for liveness and run counts.
- `board skill` prints this exact checked-in `skill/SKILL.md` file, byte-for-byte, with no JSON wrapper.

### JSON and errors

Successful `--json` output goes to stdout. JSON errors go to stderr, leave stdout empty, and use the
stable envelope `{"error":{"code":N,"kind":"...","message":"...","details":...}}`; `kind` and
`details` are additive and may be absent. An error the **daemon** raised carries its protocol code —
1 bad request, 2 not found, 3 invalid state, 4 Herdr unavailable, 5 internal, 6 work plugin
unavailable. An error the **CLI**
itself raised carries `{"code":64,"kind":"cli"}`.

Bad enum values are one shape everywhere: `invalid <kind> '<value>' (expected: a, b, c)`.

### Exit codes

Scripted agents should branch on `$?`, not on stderr text.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1`–`6` | The daemon's protocol code, passed straight through (see above). |
| `64` | The CLI itself refused: a clap usage/parse error, a declined confirmation prompt, a bad enum value, a column name that resolves to nothing client-side, or a missing `$BOARD_CARD_ID`. `EX_USAGE`. |
| `70` | The daemon reported a protocol code outside `1..=6`. Clamped, because an exit status is taken mod 256. `EX_SOFTWARE`. |

```bash
board done --outcome ok || case $? in
  2) echo "no open run for this card" ;;
  4) echo "herdr is unavailable; retry later" ;;
  64) echo "my own invocation was wrong" ;;
esac
```

### Aliases

Legacy top-level run/action forms remain supported and re-dispatch into the nested handlers:
`board comment`, `board done`, `board move`, `board cancel`, and `board retry`. `card new` and
`--to-board` are also retained aliases. Prefer the nested forms above for new automation.

## Creating work

Create the card first, then move it into an `auto` column:

```bash
board card create --title "Add retry to the uploader" \
  -d "Retry failed PUTs 3x with backoff and add a unit test." \
  --effort low --space-kind new-workspace --space-ref uploader \
  --space-cwd /path/to/repo
board card move <new-card-id> Execute
```

The agent will comment and call `board done`; the daemon applies the column transition until a manual
gate is reached. Never bypass that transition with a self-directed `move`.
