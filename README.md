**Turn a kanban card into a real AI coding agent running in a visible Herdr pane.** Cards hold
prompts, columns define pipeline stages, and moving work across the board can plan, execute, review,
and stop at human gates automatically.

The TUI is mobile-first: a compact, touch-friendly layout that fits phones and small terminals —
the same board, anywhere.

## Why herdr-board?

- **Agents stay visible.** New runs open in a stable per-card `card-<id>` Herdr tab. A managed tab converges to exactly its one harness pane — the shell anchor is closed once the launch succeeds — while configured harnesses keep a persistent anchor because their child exits with the run.
- **Pipelines, not just a queue.** Each column can prepend a system prompt and route successful or
  failed runs to another stage.
- **Human gates where they matter.** Automatic stages keep moving; manual columns stop the pipeline
  for approval.
- **Projects with named boards.** A project is a folder/Git root holding an independent set of
  named boards (each project's first board is `main`); non-Git directories use their canonical
  CWD. The preserved `Global` project remains available with `p`.
- **One binary.** `board` provides the TUI, daemon, and CLI used by both humans and agents.
- **Session- and workspace-aware.** One daemon can dispatch cards across every Herdr session and
  existing or newly created workspaces.
- **History stays with the card.** Comments, runs, outcomes, retries, and archived cards remain
  available for inspection.
- **Mobile-first TUI.** The responsive layout keeps the board usable on phones and small terminals,
  with touch-friendly navigation and controls.

## How it works

- A **card** contains a title, base prompt, harness/model/effort/permission settings, and a target
  Herdr session and workspace.
- A **column** can define a system prompt, automatic or manual triggering, timeout, and separate
  success/failure destinations.
- Moving a card into an automatic column queues a run: the daemon resolves the session, opens or
  reuses the workspace, and starts the agent in a visible pane.
- The agent reads card/run environment variables and uses the `board` CLI to comment and report its
  outcome; the daemon then applies the column transition — the next automatic stage or a manual gate.

```text
┌────────┐  ┌────────┐
│  TUI   │  │  CLI   │   interfaces — humans and agents
└───┬────┘  └───┬────┘
    └─────┬─────┘
       ┌──┴─────┐
       │ boardd │   daemon — queue, dispatch, lifecycle
       └───┬────┘
           │
       ┌───┴────┐
       │  herdr │   one visible pane per run
       └────────┘
```

`boardd` runs as a background daemon and orchestrates everything; the TUI and the CLI are the two
interfaces that talk to it. The CLI also exposes `board skill`, which prints the exact contract a
dispatched agent is held to. All board state lives under `~/.local/share/herdr-board/`; Herdr's own
state is never modified.

Opened inside a herdr space that the work plugin has bound to a Linear project, `board tui` runs in
**Linear mode**: it renders that project's issues, worktrees and live panes from the plugin's
snapshot instead of a kanban, and writes nothing. The daemon runs the plugin's `bin/work-snapshot.sh`
from the installed `work@shrimpshack` plugin; until a plugin release with that script is installed,
point `BOARD_WORK_PLUGIN_ROOT` (or `[daemon] work_plugin_root` in the config) at a plugin checkout.
`board linear snapshot <workspace-id> --json` prints the same document from the command line. See
[`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) section 13.

## Install

```bash
herdr plugin install nelsonPires5/herdr-board --ref v0.17.0
```

Open the board:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke open-board --plugin herdr-board
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Set up a keybinding to open the board from anywhere</strong></summary>

An optional keybinding (`prefix+shift+k`, so **Shift+K** after your prefix) opens the board from
anywhere. It is not configured automatically — add it to your Herdr config at
`~/.config/herdr/config.toml`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+shift+k"
type = "shell"
command = "herdr plugin action invoke open-board --plugin herdr-board"
description = "open herdr-board kanban (overlay)"
```

Herdr's default prefix is `ctrl+b`, so with defaults the binding is `Ctrl+B Shift+K` (if your
prefix is `ctrl+a`, it is `Ctrl+A Shift+K`). Do not reuse `prefix+k` — it is Herdr's
`focus_pane_up` by default.

### Supported harnesses

| Harness | Integration (precise status) | GitHub |
|---|---|---|
| **Pi** (default) | `herdr integration install pi` | [earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) |
| **Claude Code** | `herdr integration install claude` | [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| **Codex** | `herdr integration install codex` | [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) |
| **OpenCode** | `herdr integration install opencode` | [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) |
| **Antigravity** (CLI `agy`) | `herdr integration install antigravity-cli` | [google-antigravity/antigravity-cli](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli) |

<details>
<summary><strong>Requirements and details</strong></summary>

- Requires exactly **Herdr 0.9.0 (socket protocol 22)**, Git, and a Rust toolchain with `cargo`;
  Linux and macOS are supported. The daemon rejects any other Herdr version or protocol before
  workspace discovery and pane launch.
- Board protocol **v1**, SQLite schema **v15** (`schema.sql`; upgrades via `board-core::db`).
- The installer copies the `board` CLI to `~/.local/bin` — make sure that directory is on your
  `PATH` (`HERDR_BOARD_CLI_INSTALL_DIR` overrides it before installing).
- Without the harness integration the board still dispatches and accepts `board done`, but runs in
  degraded mode without precise working/blocked/done signals.
- To open the board as a tab instead of an overlay:

  ```bash
  herdr plugin pane open --plugin herdr-board --entrypoint board --placement tab --focus
  ```

- Custom CLI directory, harness integration, optional agent skill, and named sessions:
  [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

## Developing in the Docker sandbox

Contributors and coding agents can run the complete test gates — including every live E2E scenario
against a container-local Herdr — without touching the host's active Herdr, board daemon, or
sessions: `./scripts/sandbox.sh prepare` once, then `./scripts/sandbox.sh gates` after every edit.
It also opens shells, runs `board` CLI commands and the interactive TUI against the isolated
environment, and gates real-provider agent dispatches (pi/codex/antigravity) behind an explicit
opt-in with the provider credentials mounted read-only. Works with Docker
Engine on Linux and Colima on macOS, on amd64 and arm64. See
[`docs/sandbox.md`](docs/sandbox.md).

## Quickstart

1. Open the board: `herdr plugin action invoke open-board --plugin herdr-board` (or your keybinding).
2. On an empty board press `T` to apply the example pipeline, or `N` to create your own columns.
3. Press `n` to create a card. Pi is selected by default; leave the model at `(default)` to use
   Pi's configured default, pick the thinking effort if needed, then select session and workspace.
4. Move the card into an automatic column with `m`, `H` / `L`, or drag-and-drop.
5. Watch the agent appear in its stable `card-<id>` tab. `Enter` opens card detail; the agent
   comments and calls `board done` when its stage finishes.

The same flow from the shell:

```bash
board card create --title "Add retry to the uploader" \
  -d "In src/upload.rs, retry failed PUTs 3x with backoff. Add a unit test." \
  --effort low \
  --space-kind new-workspace --space-ref uploader --space-cwd /path/to/repo
board move <new-card-id> Execute
```

## CLI at a glance

`board` is one binary with a nested canonical taxonomy. **[`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md) is the
full reference** — every flag, every return shape, and the agent lifecycle rules. `board skill`
prints those exact bytes, so a dispatched agent can read the contract it is held to.

`--board`, `--project`, and `--json` are **global**: all parse before or after the subcommand.

```bash
board --board <ID|PATH> card list --json
board card list --board <ID|PATH> --json     # identical
board --project /path/to/repo board list
```

`--board` takes a stable board id or canonical scope path; `--project` takes a canonical scope path
(a Git root or existing directory). Without them, board-aware commands use the **selected project**
(and its selected board); the first board-aware command bootstraps the selection from the focused
Git root (or canonical non-Git CWD; `BOARD_SCOPE_PATH` overrides both). Card-id operations infer
the card's own board; `card create`, `card list`, `column list`, and board commands use the
selected/current board.

| Noun | Verbs |
|---|---|
| `board project` | `list`, `show [PATH]`, `create PATH`, `select PATH [--board ID|NAME]` |
| `board board` | `list [--all|--project PATH]`, `show [ID|PATH|NAME]`, `open PATH`, `create NAME [--project PATH]`, `select ID|NAME [--project PATH]`, `rename [SELECTOR] NAME` |
| `board template` | `apply <NAME>` |
| `board card` | `create` (alias `new`), `edit`, `show`, `list`, `move`, `duplicate`, `archive`, `restore`, `delete` |
| `board card comment` | `add`, `show`, `edit`, `delete`, `history` |
| `board card run` | `done`, `confirm`, `cancel`, `retry`, `focus` |
| `board column` | `list`, `create`, `show`, `edit`, `reorder`, `delete` |
| `board harness` | `list`, `models`, `efforts`, `permissions` |
| `board space` / `board session` | `list` |
| `board linear` | `snapshot <WORKSPACE_ID>` (the Linear-mode read) |
| `board tui` · `board daemon` · `board version` · `board skill` | see below |

Legacy top-level forms stay supported and re-dispatch into the nested handlers: `board comment`,
`board done`, `board move`, `board cancel`, `board retry`. `card new` and `--to-board` remain
aliases. Cross-board `move` should use `--destination-board`; a cross-**project** move uses
`--to-project PATH --to-board NAME|ID`. The old global-`--board` fallback still works but warns on
stderr.

### Daemon

```text
board daemon start [--foreground]     # run boardd in this process
board daemon stop [--json]            # graceful stop -> {"stopped":bool,"was_running":bool}
board daemon status [--json]          # {version, db_path, herdr_connected, active_runs, queued_runs}
```

Bare `board daemon` still runs the daemon, and the historical `--foreground` / `--stop` flags still
work but are hidden from `--help`. `board version [--json]` never starts boardd and reports
`{cli_version, daemon_version}`, with `null`/`unavailable` when boardd is offline.

<details>
<summary><strong>JSON output, exit codes, configuration, and maintenance</strong></summary>

Successful `--json` goes to stdout; JSON errors go to stderr with stdout left empty, in the stable
envelope `{"error":{"code":N,"kind":"...","message":"...","details":...}}` (`kind` and `details` are
additive and may be absent). Errors from the daemon carry its protocol code; errors the CLI itself
raised carry `{"code":64,"kind":"cli"}`.

The exit status carries the same number, so scripts branch on `$?` instead of parsing stderr:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1`–`6` | Daemon protocol code: bad request, not found, invalid state, Herdr unavailable, internal, work plugin unavailable |
| `64` | The CLI itself refused — usage/parse error, declined confirmation, bad enum value, unresolvable column, missing `$BOARD_CARD_ID` (`EX_USAGE`) |
| `70` | Daemon reported a protocol code outside `1..=6`, clamped (`EX_SOFTWARE`) |
