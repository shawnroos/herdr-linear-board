# AGENTS.md

Cross-agent contributor guide for herdr-board. Read this before touching the repo. herdr-board is a
kanban board that dispatches AI coding agents into visible herdr panes; the single `board` binary is
TUI + daemon + CLI. Rust, cargo workspace, edition 2021, all crates share the workspace version.
Feature PRs target the long-lived `dev` branch; `main` is production (branch model:
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md)).

## Development workflow (sandbox-first)

Local test and development runs use the Docker sandbox by default:
`./scripts/sandbox.sh gates` runs every gate and the live E2E suite in an isolated,
network-disabled, non-root container with the worktree read-only (setup, modes, and
troubleshooting: [`docs/sandbox.md`](docs/sandbox.md)). Do **not** run `cargo test`,
`e2e/run-all.sh`/`e2e/ci.sh`, the TUI, or real-provider agent runs directly against the host
Herdr/board — that conflicts with the user's active environment. Follow the
[`development-workflow` skill](.agents/skills/development-workflow/SKILL.md) for the
edit-test loop, interactive shell/board CLI/TUI, the explicit opt-in real-provider agent
mode (pi/codex/antigravity), visual validation through the sandbox, and the handoff
checklist. Host-side execution is an explicit, documented exception only.

## Workspace layout & crate ownership

| Crate | Owns | Never leaks into |
|---|---|---|
| `board-core` | models, `board-core::protocol` types, SQLite db + migrations, the pure column engine, prompt assembly, harness adapters, config, the blocking boardd client | herdr/tokio/ratatui specifics |
| `board-herdr` | the Herdr unix-socket client (envelope, typed workspace/tab/agent/pane/notification/session calls, event stream) | board state; no worktree API |
| `board-tui` | the ratatui app (`run()` entry), forms, snapshot tests | daemon logic |
| `board-daemon` | boardd server: run queue, dispatch, per-session herdr clients, watchers, spawner | — |
| `board-cli` | the `board` binary: clap subcommands wiring the above | business logic |

Ownership is strict: edit your crate(s) + append to root `[workspace.dependencies]`. Semantics
source of truth: `docs/protocol.md` + `docs/design.md`. Docs live in `docs/` (index: `docs/README.md`);
`schema.sql` is the fresh-schema source of truth and `board-core::db` owns upgrades. Final compatibility
schema v15
live catalog is `e2e/README.md` (scenarios 01–42); `e2e/test-harness.sh` is the provider-free static
safety gate.

## Build / test gates (keep green)

The gate list has one maintained copy: **[`docs/README.md` → Test gates](docs/README.md#test-gates-single-source)**
(mirrored by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `scripts/tests/test_docs.py` fails if the two drift).

- The Python tier is a CI gate too (`ci.yml`'s `Python tests` step) and is easy to forget:
  `scripts/tests/test_docs.py` pins the version matrix (schema v15, protocol 22, Herdr 0.9.0)
  and the exact `e2e/NN-*.sh` catalog, so adding a scenario or bumping the schema fails here
  until the docs and that test are updated together.

- `#[ignore]`'d tests hit a live herdr (run only when `HERDR_SOCK`/`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` exists).
- End-to-end: `e2e/run-all.sh` (compat: `scripts/e2e.sh`) drives a REAL Herdr; checked-in fake
  Pi/Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Antigravity (`agy`) executables keep the standard suite (scenarios 01–42) provider-free and zero-cost, except `41-linear-bind-handoff.sh`, which starts the real `claude` and skips without it.
  **Hard rules an agent must never violate:** run only against the scenario's own **ephemeral**
  `hb-e2e-<slug>-<pid>-<random64>` session and **disposable** workspaces it created — never a user
  session, workspace, or tab — and prefix every Herdr mutation with `HERDR MUTATION:`.
  The full isolation, identity-token, and cleanup design is in
  [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) ("How it stays isolated and safe") — read it before
  touching the harness.

## Testing policy (pragmatic)

Full layering, test placement, harness details, and how to add tests live in
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

- **Test-first for behavior.** For any behavior change, write the failing test first
  (red→green) in the owning crate's existing style. Behavior through a public API belongs in
  `crates/<crate>/tests/`, where it is compiled as an external client. A test that deliberately
  checks a private invariant stays adjacent to its implementation under `src/` in a
  `#[cfg(test)]` module; do not make production internals public just to relocate such a test.
- **Responsibility-oriented modules.** Put new code behind the boundary that already owns the
  responsibility rather than growing an entry-point file. The current stable boundaries:

  | Crate | Boundary | Owns |
  |---|---|---|
  | `board-daemon` | `ops/` | request operations; `ops/errors.rs` is the one place a domain failure becomes a protocol code, `ops/panes.rs` the caller's-own-session pane calls |
  | | `dispatch/` | queue lifecycle; `launch_plan.rs` builds the launch spec, `ownership.rs` decides what this daemon may claim |
  | | `spawner/` | launch and placement; `placement/` (alloc/geometry/race), `herdr/` (managed + configured), `error.rs` |
  | | `watchers/` | timeout/liveness/Herdr observation |
  | | `herdr_conn.rs` | the gated connect: normalize the socket path, connect, run the 0.9.0/protocol-22 check, in one place. New placement, discovery, and mutation paths go through it. The two space-resolution sites that still connect directly (`ops/cards.rs`, `dispatch/launch_plan.rs`) run the same gate inside `dispatch/space.rs`; cleanup/observation retain an ungated client only for panes this daemon already owns |
  | | `rescue.rs`, `recovery.rs`, `logging.rs`, `testkit.rs` | run rescue, per-session recovery, tracing setup, and the `cfg(test)` daemon/fake-Herdr builders |
  | `board-tui` | `app/` | the pure reducer — `state`/`effect`/`nav`/`drag` plus one module per screen |
  | | `driver/` | the effect loop (`dispatch`, `load`); `runtime.rs` owns terminal setup/teardown, `origin.rs` the Herdr-plugin origin context |
  | | `forms/`, `view/`, `widgets/` | form model, rendering, hit-testing |
  | `board-cli` | `args/` | the clap surface, split by domain; **backward compatibility is mandatory** — new spellings are additive, old ones become (sometimes hidden) aliases |
  | | `render.rs` | the single output path. Handlers never branch on `--json`: they hand a value to `emit`/`emit_line`, and every text listing goes through one `table` helper |
  | | `context.rs` | lazy client/board resolution and client-side column lookup |
  | `board-core` | `engine/` | pure decisions — lifecycle, transitions, validation, signals, `columns.rs` |
  | | `client/` | traits, Unix transport, fake client |
  | `board-herdr` | `events/` | event parsing and streams |

  Before adding a helper, check `board-core` for one: `Patch::from_flags`/`from_option`,
  `protocol::parse_timestamp`, `capability::default_capabilities`, `engine::resolve_column`,
  `engine::run_elapsed`, `Comment::is_system`, `paths::session_name_from_socket`, and
  `Db::require_card`/`require_column` are shared primitives, not per-crate copies.

  Keep private tests beside those boundaries; describe ownership rather than maintaining a
  file-by-file test manifest.
- **New herdr-touching flow ⇒ e2e.** Any new user-visible flow that reaches herdr isn't done until
  it has a use case documented and a live scenario under `e2e/` (per `docs/testing.md` and
  `e2e/README.md`).
- **Trivial changes are exempt** — docs, comments, typos, pure renames need no new test.
- **Green before handoff.** The gates above **and** `e2e/run-all.sh` must pass (all scenarios
  PASS — the suite boots its own ephemeral session(s), so 03-sessions no longer skips) before
  handing a change off. The configured runner's residual orphan-script limitation remains
  documented; it is not silently treated as a cleanup guarantee.

## Conventions

- `anyhow` at edges, `thiserror` in core. No `unwrap()` outside tests.
- Inject clocks/paths — the engine takes `now: i64`; paths via `directories` + env overrides
  (`BOARD_DB`, `BOARD_SOCKET`). No wall-clock flakiness in tests.
- Commit style: **Conventional Commits** grouped by crate/intent, as in the git log —
  `feat(core): …`, `feat(daemon,cli): …`, `docs: …`.
- The daemon opens a **fresh Herdr connection per operation** — so the protocol gate lives at the
  connect, not at a startup check; that is what `board-daemon/src/herdr_conn.rs` centralizes. One
  `HerdrClient` = one request/response connection, event streaming lives on its own connection.
  Runtime launch ownership is daemon-only: `board-core`
  persists the neutral schema-v11 launch spec, while `board-daemon` owns placement, pane/process
  handles, liveness, cleanup, and the Herdr supervisor.
- `RootConfig` is parsed once at daemon startup; typed `[daemon]` settings are resolved before
  environment overrides, and malformed existing config is fatal. CLI and TUI use typed
  `board-core::client::BoardClient` wrappers rather than raw method/result handling.
- Auto-start creates one child process-group leader (no double-fork/`setsid`); stop is an exact
  socket/identity-gated operation. The active-run summary drives TUI timers, and the always-on
  per-session supervisor reconnects and reconciles conservatively.
- Definition of done for a user-facing change: update the docs and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change. `Unreleased` entries are grouped under Keep-a-Changelog categories (`### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed`), one entry per PR, and each entry is one short sentence of user-facing outcome — what the user can do or see, never env var names, internal flags, module names, or tuning numbers (an internal refactor with no visible change gets one short line or none). Every entry starts with the clickable PR link — GitHub does not auto-link bare `#NN` inside rendered markdown — and fits ≤ 200 chars total: `- [#31](https://github.com/nelsonPires5/herdr-board/pull/31) feat: Pin Herdr plugin installs to a released tag.` The PR body holds the rationale. `scripts/tests/test_docs.py` enforces these rules for `Unreleased` (released sections are exempt). Write the entry first, then fill in the PR link once the PR is open.
- Release/version changes follow [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md). Agents must never create,
  push, move, or delete release tags manually: a maintainer starts **Prepare Release**, merges its
  PR into `dev`, the **Promote** workflow merges `dev -> main`, and the **Release** workflow creates
  the tag only after `main` CI is green at that promotion SHA. Repository rulesets protect `main`
  (PR-only, merge-commit, required fast CI) and `v*` tags (deletion/force-update); this is
  policy and workflow validation together. Bot-created PRs (release, promotion) need one manual
  approval of their workflow runs before CI executes — see `docs/releasing.md`.
- Branching: `dev` is the long-lived integration branch and the default target for feature PRs;
  `main` is production (default branch, Release's only publish path). The `dev -> main` promotion
  and hotfix PRs are opened/merged by the workflows themselves. After every promotion or hotfix,
  back-merge `main -> dev` before the next normal release.

## herdr gotchas (field-tested)

**Learning/verifying herdr is its own page.** herdr has no man page; the authoritative
sources are the installed binary itself — `herdr api schema --json` (methods/types/events +
protocol number), `herdr <cmd> --help`, `herdr api snapshot`. Never assume a herdr command,
flag, or JSON shape from memory, and pin the argv you verified in a test comment. Repo herdr
facts are pinned to exactly **Herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22**. herdr-board intentionally rejects every
other Herdr version and protocol; re-verify against `api schema` before changing that gate or any
wire behavior. **See [`docs/herdr.md`](docs/herdr.md).**

- **Never run destructive herdr commands against a user's workspaces/sessions.** Mutations only
  against disposable workspaces you created (see `e2e/`). Read-only probes otherwise.
- **Agent names are exclusive** while a pane is open. Names are `card-<id>-<column-slug>`; on an
  `agent_name_taken` collision the daemon retries with the `-r<run>` fallback.
- **Panes don't inherit the workspace's env/cwd.** Managed-agent launch is pane-first:
  `tab.create`/`pane.split` establishes cwd + env, then `agent.start` targets that pane with
  `{name, kind, pane_id, args}`. Workspace cwd is read from the workspace's pane snapshot.
- Current durable runs use stable `card-<id>` tab labels, but reuse only an exact board-owned `tab_id` reconstructed from durable pane identity; labels are never ownership. Legacy `kanban` tabs remain untouched and legacy-only.
- **Herdr events are a raw-socket stream** (`events.subscribe`, persistent connection); the CLI only
  has a blocking one-shot `events.wait`. Protocol-19 `pane_agent_status_changed` carries pane,
  workspace, agent, and status fields; `idle ≠ finished`, and a trailing `idle` may follow `done`
  (completion still needs the explicit `board done` channel). Watcher identity is `(session socket,
  pane id)`, not pane id alone.
- **AF_UNIX paths cap at 108 chars.** Test DBs/sockets must live under a short `/tmp` dir
  (`tempfile::tempdir()`), not a deep nested path, or `connect` fails with a cryptic error.
