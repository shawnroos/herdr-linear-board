//! The clap surface, split by domain.
//!
//! Every public path is re-exported here, so `crate::args::X` keeps working for
//! all command handlers. Two rules hold across this module:
//!
//! * **Backward compatibility is mandatory** — this CLI is scripted by agents.
//!   New spellings are additive and old ones become (sometimes hidden) aliases.
//! * `--json` is one `global = true` flag on [`Cli`], accepted before or after
//!   the subcommand path, instead of being redeclared on every leaf command.
