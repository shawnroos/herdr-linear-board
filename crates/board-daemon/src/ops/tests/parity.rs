//! Fake-client ↔ daemon method parity.
//!
//! `board_core::client::FakeBoardClient` re-implements part of boardd's RPC
//! surface and the **entire** board-tui test tier runs against it, so a method
//! the daemon routes but the fake does not is a hole a TUI suite cannot see: a
//! reducer path calling it passes its own tests and only fails live. Both lists
//! are generated from their own dispatch tables (`routes!` / `fake_methods!`),
//! so neither can drift from the code that actually answers requests.

///   `DemoClient` stubs these on top of the fake for the form suites.
/// - `run.cancel` / `run.retry` — reachable from the TUI (`Effect::RunCancel` /
///   `Effect::RunRetry`) but they mean "kill a pane" / "enqueue a run", which a
///   DB-only fake with no dispatcher cannot honestly model.
/// - `run.pane_exited` — the internal configured-harness wrapper callback; no
