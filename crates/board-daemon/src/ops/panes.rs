//! `pane.set_title`: rename one pane in the **caller's own** herdr session.
//!
//! The daemon owns every Herdr interaction (`AGENTS.md`), so a client that
//! wants its own pane border relabelled asks for it here instead of shelling
//! out to `herdr pane rename` itself. The only current caller is the TUI
//! plugin pane keeping its border in sync with the board it shows.

/// Rename `pane_id` in the session `origin_socket` belongs to.
///
/// Takes no [`Daemon`](crate::state::Daemon): this touches no board state, only
/// the caller's own Herdr session. That session is named by `origin_socket`
/// exactly as it is for `run.focus`, because only the caller knows which Herdr
/// it is running inside; the socket is canonicalized and then opened through
/// [`crate::herdr_conn`], so the pinned Herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22 gate applies
/// before the rename reaches it.
///
/// **A failure here is a real error (code 4), not a silent success.** The
/// daemon must not answer `{renamed:true}` for a rename that did not happen:
/// this method is also readable from the CLI, the logs, and e2e, and those
/// callers need the diagnosis. Treating a cosmetic pane title as non-fatal is
/// the *caller's* policy — the TUI drops the result, exactly as it dropped the
/// subprocess exit status before — and it stays in that one layer.
///
/// Control and format characters are stripped here rather than trusted to the
/// TUI, because any socket client can call this. Brackets survive: the kanban
/// title is `Board [scope · FILTER]`.
