//! Application state machine: `App` state, `Screen`, synthetic `Msg`s, and the
//! pure `update(&mut App, Msg) -> Vec<Effect>` reducer. Rendering lives in `view`;
//! I/O (client calls, `$EDITOR`) lives in `driver` via the returned [`Effect`]s.
//!
//! Keeping `update` free of I/O is what lets tests drive synthetic key/mouse
//! events and assert on state (navigation, form cycling, drag transitions) and on
//! rendered snapshots deterministically.
//!
//! This module holds only the core machine — `Screen`, `App` and its board
//! queries, `update`/`on_key`. Everything around it is a sibling module:
//!
//! | module | holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`state`] | the modal/mini-mode state types `App` owns |
//! | [`effect`] | the [`Effect`] alphabet `update` emits |
//! | [`nav`] | the shared `↑/↓` decoder, clamped stepping, board selection |
//! | [`drag`] | the mouse-drag lifecycle |
//! | `board`/`detail`/`forms`/`picker`/`confirm`/`help`/`switcher`/`move_column`/`comment_history` | one screen's key handler each (plus, for `detail`, its viewport arithmetic) |
//! | `mouse` | all mouse input, for every screen |
